# OpenGL

This extension (group) is still in progress, it will be so great if you can join and help!

Recommend settings:

1. Clone this as a independent repo
2. Move the whole repo into [`appinventor-sources`](http://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources) `/appinventor/comopnents/src/github/OpenSourceAIX/OpenGL/`
3. Ignore this path in your local `appinventor-sources` repo, by adding the path of `OpenGL` into `.gitignore`

*Note: the package name & the location path will be changed in someday in the future if necessary.*
